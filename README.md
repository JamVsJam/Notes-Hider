# WinUtils

A set of Windows utilities.

## Notes Hider

Hide the Sticky Notes icon from Windows taskbar. Once Sticky Notes begin execution, its taskbar icon is automatically hidden. This program is added to Windows startup automatically by the installer.

## Web Shutdown

Turn off your computer from anywhere. This program shuts down the system based on specific HTTP requests in the format `http://SERVER/shutdown?auth=PASSWORD`. This means you can use your mobile device to turn off your computer by simply tapping a web shortcut. Since the password is visible in the URL, it is recommended to use this utility only under trusted networks, for example at home.

## Send Tray

Send almost any Windows application to the system tray by right-clicking its minimize button. This is a modified version of RBTray. This program is added to Windows startup automatically by the installer.

## Toggle Hidden

Add the `CTRL + H` shortcut to Windows Explorer for quickly toggling the hidden files setting. This program is added to Windows startup automatically by the installer.

## Screen Write

Print standard input to the screen. This program can be used in command-line scripting as graphical replacement for console windows. Java is required.
